# add-ons repository for FreeCAD

This repository is a collection of useful additional workbenches and modules for FreeCAD made by community members, gathered here for your convenience.

Since these are not part of the official FreeCAD package and not supported by the FreeCAD team, you should read the information provided on each of the addons page above before installing any of them, to make sure you know what you are installing. Also, bug reports and feature requests should be made directly on each addon page.

### Current add-ons
For a description of each Addon please see [FreeCAD-Addon-Details](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons/blob/master/FreeCAD-Addon-Details.md). It is also possible to click on each linked Addon repository to read their README files.  

### Installing

#### Important Note
***Starting from FreeCAD v. 0.17.9940 the addons installer is included in FreeCAD, and can be accessed from the Tools menu, so there is no need to install macros to do this. For older versions of FC please see the Deprecated Installation Methods section***

#### 1. Builtin Addon Manager

With version 0.17 FreeCAD now has a built-in Addon Manager that will install 3rd party workbenches and macros. To access it via ***Tools -> Addon Manager*** as per the screenshot:

#### 2. Manual install

Each of these addons can be downloaded by clicking the **Download ZIP** button found on top of each addon page, or using **Git**. Most of the addons must either be placed in your user's FreeCAD/Mod folder, or in the Macros folder. Refer to the instructions on each addon page for complete instructions. 

**Note**: Your user's FreeCAD folder location is obtained by typing in FreeCAD's python console: `FreeCAD.ConfigGet("UserAppData")`while the Macros folder location is indicated in the dialog opened from menu *Macro -> Macros...*

### Adding your workbench to the collection

Have you made an interesting workbench or module that we are not aware of? Tell us on the [FreeCAD forum](http://forum.freecadweb.org) so we can add it here!

### Deprecated Installation Methods
Before FreeCAD v. 0.17.9940 the methods below were utilized to automate the installation of workbenches and macros. This sections is being kept for historical purposes.

#### 1. Using the installer macro

The installer macro can be launched from inside FreeCAD, and will download and install any of the addons above automatically. To install the installer macro:

1. Download [addons_installer.FCMacro](https://rawgit.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons/master/addons_installer.FCMacro)
2. Place the downloaded macro in your **FreeCAD Macros folder**. The FreeCAD Macros folder location is indicated in menu **Macros -> Macros -> User macros location**:

3. Restart FreeCAD. The addons installer will now be listed in menu **Macro -> Macros** and can be launched by selecting it then clicking the **Execute** button:

#### 2. Using the "pluginloader" addon

The plugin loader is a much more elaborate way to install and manage additional content for freecad. Install it with the method above, or following the instructions on the [pluginloader page](https://github.com/microelly2/freecad-pluginloader).
