# add-ons repository for FreeCAD

This repository is a collection of useful additional workbenches and modules for FreeCAD made by community members, gathered here for your convenience.

Since these are not part of the official FreeCAD package and not supported by the FreeCAD team, although this list is curated and maintained by the FreeCAD team, you should read the information provided on each of the addons page above before installing any of them, to make sure you know what you are installing. Also, bug reports and feature requests should be made directly on each addon page.

**Note**: The commit number indicated in the github tree above is not considered by the Addons Manager. What is installed or updated is always the latest *master* branch of every addon

### Current add-ons
For a description of each Addon please see [FreeCAD-Addon-Details](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons/blob/master/FreeCAD-Addon-Details.md). It is also possible to click on each linked Addon repository to read their README files.  

### Installing

#### Important Note
***Starting from FreeCAD v0.17.9940 the Addon Manager was finally implemented in to FreeCAD. It can be accessed from the dropdown Tools -> 'Addon Manager' menu. For earlier versions (â‰¤v0.16), please see the [Deprecated Installation Methods](#deprecated-installation-methods) section***.

#### 1. Builtin Addon Manager

With version 0.17 FreeCAD now has a built-in Addon Manager that will install 3rd party workbenches and macros. To access it via ***Tools -> Addon Manager*** as per the screenshot:

#### 2. Manual install

Each of these addons can be downloaded by clicking the **Download ZIP** button found on top of each addon page, or using **Git**. Most of the addons must either be placed in your user's FreeCAD/Mod folder, or in the Macros folder. Refer to the instructions on each addon page for complete instructions. 

**Note**: Your user's FreeCAD folder location is obtained by typing in FreeCAD's python console: `FreeCAD.ConfigGet("UserAppData")`while the Macros folder location is indicated in the dialog opened from menu *Macro -> Macros...*
