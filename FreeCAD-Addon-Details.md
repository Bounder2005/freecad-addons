<details>
  <summary>Details...</summary>
<img src="https://github.com/mwganson/DynamicData/blob/master/Resources/icons/DynamicDataLogo.png">With this workbench you can create custom FeaturePython objects to serve as containers for custom properties. These custom properties can then be used in much the same way as cells in a spreadsheet. Users can refer to a custom property in a sketcher constraint (or from anywhere the Expression Engine can be accessed) the same way one might refer to a cell in a spreadsheet. Take note that FCStd files containing these DynamicData dd objects can be shared with other users who do not have the DynamicData workbench installed on there systems and yet will still remain fully functional. (But without the workbench installed those other users will not be able to add/remove properties unless it is done via scripting.)

#### [Part-o-magic](https://github.com/DeepSOIC/Part-o-magic/)
Experiment on FreeCAD-wide automation of Part container management 

<details>
  <summary>Details...</summary>
Compatible with FreeCAD v0.17. (It won't work with FC v0.16.)

The goal is to experiment with UI and ways to bring assembly infrastructure into the whole FreeCAD. Sure you have seen that new PartDesign things called Part and Body. The aim of Part-o-magic is to bring similar things to every workbench in FreeCAD, and make working with them more convenient.

With Part-o-magic, organizing a multi-part project (i.e. an assembly) is much easier.

Beware. Part-o-magic is an epic hack. It will collide with similar functionality in FreeCAD as it is introduced. In case of doubt, you can always switch to Part-o-magic workbench, and disable Observer.

#### [lattice2](https://github.com/DeepSOIC/Lattice2/)
FreeCAD workbench with advanced array tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details...</summary>
The workbench purpose is working with placements and arrays of placements. It is a sort of assembly workbench, but with emphasis on arrays. There are no constraints and relations, there are just arrays of placements that can be generated, combined, transformed, superimposed and populated with shapes. 

Ever wondered how to create a protractor with FreeCAD? That's the aim of the workbench (including tick labeling). Also, exploded assemblies can be made with the workbench.

Additionally, the workbench features a few general-purpose tools, such as parametric downgrade, bounding boxes, shape info tool, and tools for working with collections of shapes (compounds).

One of the big design goals of the workbench is being as parametric as possible.

#### [ret3d](https://github.com/Maaphoo/Retr3d/)
Retr3d (ˈriːˌtred) is a framework dedicated to affordable 3D printing equipment for developing economies that can be locally sourced, locally maintained and locally improved.

<details>
  <summary>Details...</summary>
We believe that 3D printing can be as transformative in developing countries as the mobile phone. As with the mobile phone, which has already changed the way people across the Africa communicate, introducing 3D printing at the community level offers the potential to localize manufacturing. Which is why we are making it possible to build Retr3d machines from the thousands of tonnes of e-waste which would otherwise end up as landfill.

Retr3d uses python and FreeCAD to 3D model printable parts for the construction of more 3D printers. Through globalVars.py dimensions of procured e-waste are turned into customized 3D models. Retr3d's software depends on FreeCAD's python scripting API.
